    <h2><b>Access ToR</b></h2> <br>
    <p>
        If you want to be more secure and anonymous on the internet you would want to try TOR <br>
        This guide is for those who wish to anonymously access our website and submit <b>qiybÉ™t</b>. <br>
        Follow the steps below and you will be able to access a more secure and anonymous version of our website.
    </p> <br> <br>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h3>1. Download the TOR browser</h3>
    <p>
        Head to TOR project <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/"><i>(click here to be redirected)</i></a> and choose your operating system.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h3>2. Connecting to TOR</h3>
    <p>
        If the installation was successful you should see the page below. To connect to the browser simply click connect.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h3>3. Enter our website</h3>
    <p>
        To access our website simply copy the onion link in bold <b>onion link here</b> and paste it in the search bar of the tor browser. <br>
        It will take some time to load since the browser goes through many IP addresses before accessing our website so bear with it. <br>
        p.s this wont work on a regular browser so dont try it
    </p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h3>4. Extra information</h3>
    <p>
        When you search something you can click the "circuit" symbol located at the top left part of the page. This will enable <br>
        you to see your cicuits which are basically your connection. Everyone has different connections and everytime you <br>
        connect to tor it will change to different countries this makes it very hard for you to be tracked, the circuit is the <br>
        reason why tor is the safest and the most anonymous browser. This is also the browser you can use to enter the <br>
        dark web :)
    </p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h3>Psst.. You wanna access the DarkNet?</h3>
    <p>
        If you are a new person on the dark net and want to get better at navigating on it you can visit this website on the TOR <br>
        browser only <a href="https://tor.taxi/">(site link here)</a>, you wont be able to access the DarkNet on normal browsers so you <br>
        will have to use TOR only.
    </p> <br> <br>
